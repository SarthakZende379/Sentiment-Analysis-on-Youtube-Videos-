the media are typically seen as makers
of consensus and harmony and concordance
all of that
but india is actually a spectacular case
of the opposite happening the hindus who
are the majority are being positioned as
the victims of historic injustice
and it's the minority that are being
presented as their aggressors
[Music]
the hindu public is constantly being
made to feel beleaguered they're
presented with this external threat
muslims against which they're supposed
to unite
and in the process
the viewing public is actually led to
ascent to whatever the political
leadership says
[Music]
don't look down but india is on a
precipice
the voices of hindutva hindu supremacy
are ascendant as is intolerance hate
speech it has worked its way through the
body politic like a acting poison the
effect on the muslims targeted has
proven toxic at times deadly
hate speech proposes violence as a
solution and in india it is pumped out
night after night
the country has hundreds of news
channels many of which have monetized
conflict they trade in hyper hindu
nationalism xenophobia
name calling usually in support of
india's ruling party the bjp
and prime minister narendra modi
is in your heart then why are you being
forced
it's like a gladiatorial fight
evening upon evening
with all its attendant cruelties
and the banality of hypnotic
entertainment i think sir you are
appalling
in the way you conduct yourself on
television it's appalling you're a
disgrace
and there's also this this
this joy that people find in the
collective playing of ideas that are
contrarian to establishment
or the flaying of an individual or a
community
the problem really lies in uh something
called ratings newsmakers
when it the game becomes one of
viewership and you are just trying to
grab eyeballs
until she walks in
watch renowned journalist
anything goes
the intensity
of this
battle for ratings
has made
television more and more shrill
to some extent even irresponsible
very senior panelists describe them as
banshees because because of the manner
in which they're always wailing
and this kind of dramatized tv seems to
work
because
our very insecure
down and out middle class
likes to put a face to all its
insecurities
to all its fears to all its anger its
resentment and its hate
and these people give them that that
face the face of the muslim
to understand how india got here and how
exceptional and dangerous a moment this
is in its history one has to go back in
time
[Music]
and now
the time comes
when we shall redeem our pledge
in 1947 after almost a century under
british colonial rule in south asia the
country won its independence
out of the fires of partition india
forged a constitutional commitment to
secularism and multiculturalism
hindus were the majority but all of
india's citizens were to be treated
equally under the law
[Music]
[Applause]
bit by bit decade by decade the bjp has
sold more and more hindus on the idea
that their way of life is under siege
that muslims pose a threat
and the news media which have been
transformed and effectively weaponized
have been crucial to the messenger
[Music]
the founding fathers of india had this
vision of the nation which was quite
different from pakistan a state defined
by religion and they wanted india to be
a state for all its citizens
but i think somewhere along the line
secularism or even the idea of democracy
it didn't really percolate down to
everyone in india to a point that today
these concepts perhaps only resonate
with an elite
and the bjp and its hindutva network
have been pushing at this issue this
crisis of hindu identity for a very long
time
what's happened simultaneously is a
remarkable shift in television news and
the content that you see on the news
today
[Music]
this is
news good evening and welcome
the news culture for a very long time
has been stayed and boring so the idea
that you could actually be educated by
what these voices on the air are saying
is very new
but funnily enough it's actually
welcomed
you have a hindu community that the
media are doing their very best to try
and unite
how do they do that well firstly by
positioning the sense of an external
enemy
right against whom then you're all
supposed to be united
most importantly you don't have to look
inside and ask what actually unites all
of us hindus together
so here you have these anchors telling
people
what they should think whom they should
approve of and whom they should
disapprove of
and it kind of works
narendra modi will be india's next prime
minister
and in his victory speech he described
himself as mazdur number one committing
himself to the service of the people
[Applause]
what's really changed since the bjp came
to power is that you have anchors who've
taken quite committed hyper partisan
positions
uh they've decided essentially to shield
for the government and tarnished any
other viewers anti-national
muslims today are told their beliefs
what they eat how they dress
who they fall in love with all of it is
a problem or can be a potential problem
or a crime
and so for muslim news consumers it's a
pretty bleak scenario
you would want to tune out a disengage
[Music]
in some ways it's the news outlets that
have disengaged from the stories that
are hitting people the hardest
india's agricultural sector responsible
for roughly 20 percent of its gdp is in
turmoil its health care sector exposed
by covert 19 is in critical condition
and the unemployment rate is approaching
8
that's more than 100 million people
without work
yet when the online outlet news laundry
analyzed debates across seven major news
channels earlier this year it found that
the number of programs tackling economic
problems were minimal
communal issues hindu versus muslim
debates
controversies dominate the output
and
certain terms get thrown in like jihad
and then applied to whatever grievances
indians may have
there is this whole discourse of jihad
which
loosely references the
and and this whole sense of honor
because
every community's honor seems to rest in
their women
sort of attacks the idea that muslims
should be buying land or muslims should
be building houses
this is the kind of discourse that this
ecosystem proliferates
the government the executive
with the help of the cheerleaders
has marked out not just muslims but but
dalits the tribals and people who are
generally dissenters and their labors
that describe them
anti-nationalism you want to support the
breakup of india these terms they attach
themselves to people's imaginations very
easily many of these anchors often use
the term illegal immigrants it's kind of
like a shorthand for muslims and you saw
this very recently when there was a
spirit of bulldozing of muslim homes and
shops
and you had prominent anchors climb on
top of the bulldozer in a sort of a
macabre roman spectacle
and of course there's no proof of
them being illegal some of them even in
fact have documents which show that they
have benefited from the prime minister's
housing scheme but because you can just
label these people as illegal or call
their enterprise illegal and because
it's such a spectator sport
the audience is almost numbed into
thinking that these people must deserve
it
the listening post repeatedly requested
interviews with a half dozen of india's
most prominent news anchors none wanted
to speak with us
[Music]
there is no larger religious minority
group in any country than india's
muslims 20 of the population more than
220 million people
communal tensions and violence there
have a long history and given the sheer
number of people involved what is being
said on the airwaves and echoed across
social media tolerated by the modi
government and arguably even stoked by
it our producer put this question to the
senior adviser to india's ministry of
information and broadcasting
when you consider how large india's
muslim minority is
are you concerned about the incessant
dehumanizing news coverage of that
community does the government have a
responsibility to deal with this kind of
hate speech
you know
what you call hate speech is also it can
be called clickbait speech
i would not necessarily link it to
something
directed at muslims in india
and as you rightly said it's not a small
minority i mean the word minority over
here
basically means that they are lesser in
numbers but they are not
living on the margins it's not only a
comment on on the muslims or
a comment on the minorities
some awful stuff is said about hindus
too
i would not sort of get all worked up
about it but it is worrisome
worrisome but not worth getting worked
up about
that kind of thinking alarms experts in
the history of genocide like gregory
stanton
five years before the rwandan genocide
of 1994 he warned the authorities there
that their country was in a dangerous
place stanton was ignored
the rhetoric kept coming from the
government side and some hateful voices
in the rwandan media one radio station
in particular that broadcast calls for
murder
hundreds of thousands were then
slaughtered
stanton stresses that acts of genocide
don't come out of nowhere they don't
just happen they are the catastrophic
culmination of a process
and what india is going through right
now according to stanton fits with the
pattern
the media play a huge role in
creating the polarization in a society
that is necessary for genocide they do
this through dehumanizing the
targeted group
accusing them of being a cancer in the
society or a danger to the society
traitors to the society
in rwanda you had the hate radio and
television and newspapers claiming that
the tutsis were cockroaches for example
so this kind of dehumanization
is something you find very frequently
before a genocide
[Music]
[Applause]
we have the indian home minister for
instance
using words like termites
well doesn't that sound familiar when
you study their one in genocide
every genocide depends on two forces it
depends on popular
beliefs that
include prejudices against certain
groups
and then it also requires leadership
leadership that profits from that hatred
and that uses it to build up its own
power we see both in india today
as hate and division have spread prime
minister modi has stayed mostly silent
showing the kind of discipline some of
his officials clearly lack
anarag tucker was a junior minister in
2020 when he spoke at this bjp election
rally
that got him barred from campaigning by
india's electoral commission for a total
of three days
one year later the prime minister
actually promoted takur he's now india's
minister of information and broadcasting
when asked by a reporter if his speech
that day helped set off the
intercommunal violence that followed in
new delhi this was his response
[Music]
the video of that speech is still online
there for all to see
if you
go back and look at
the unedited footage
the minister was actually
asking people to not raise
such a slogan
no footage no evidence exists
of the minister raising that slogan
but just because
some mention of it came into media
that became the truth and that truth got
further amplified it's true that anurag
thakur didn't say shoot the traitors
but he was basically
leading a chant so i wouldn't read that
as him trying to stop the crowd
[Music]
you could say he was egging them on
and even if the media is so corrupt as
to edit something and completely put it
out of context
the election commission of india they
would have seen the video and they would
have found something wrong with it to
take that action that they did take
against him
we asked for an interview with anurag
takur but got no response
recently belatedly the government has
had a rethink
and takur has reportedly met with media
owners and tv anchors urging them to
tone it down
but that will have little effect on the
poisonous material spreading online
where so many indians go to keep
informed
by people like
a right-wing hindu figure
last year he helped organize a three-day
religious gathering in haridwar
where hindus called openly for the
killing of muslims
that video trended for days
all any indian has to do to take part in
a celebratory culture of violence is go
on youtube or whatsapp
they'll find content far more explicit
and disturbing than anything they'll see
on tv
so now we have live streaming of
violence
you know your live action news and so
forth that's coming via social media
recently we had a policeman beating
muslim suspects in custody
in this case the policeman was suspended
but almost always individual acts of
violence
simply go unpunished many indians aren't
actually going to tv for their news in
fact a recent reuters report showed that
audiences are going to youtube primarily
followed by whatsapp
and you have all kinds of toxic
disinformation being shared on those
platforms we have people supposedly
religious figures who say some really
shocking things
[Music]
then there are even new players to this
game who kind of
impersonate news anchors you know
they'll feed you all kinds of nonsense
from a sort of a new studio set up
[Music]
and this stuff gets forwarded and people
have no idea what the source of news is
we find many instances of violence
against former untouchables against
muslims who may actually be blameless
and what it suggests is that violence is
actually popular
now there may be a narrative that
rationalizes this as you know
the administration of justice never mind
due process never mind the lack of
evidence
then there's a shocking truth underneath
all of this that violence against
minorities is actually popular and
that's that's difficult to digest
[Music]
narendra modi is not camera shy hardly a
day goes by without his pr team pumping
out another video of the prime minister
amongst his supporters
but modi has failed to condemn the
toxicity online or in the media which
for many indians makes him an accessory
to the hate crimes that follow
this is a prime minister who has crafted
his image and his message carefully
and his frequent participation in hindu
religious rituals is usually
made for tv
india is the second or third largest
muslim country in the world so it's
absolutely crucial that the government
be seen to be above religious
differences
but what we have is actually the
opposite
a gallop towards an increasingly
assertive hindu identity so we have you
know prime minister modi appearing on
television
meditating in a cave worshiping in hindu
temples when all of this is really
unprecedented
there's this insistence on demonstrating
that the government is a pious
government blessed by the saints
carrying out the will of god and anybody
who opposes the government who's
critical of it is an india hater
and
foreign media well they are hating india
too they're against india and of course
modi is the chief hero in the story
[Music]
what are international news outlets like
al jazeera missing in their coverage of
india right now
well i would like to see and i'm just
being very honest over here i would like
to see al jazeera
reporting news
or
reporting events
and
not being an exclusive channel
on muslim issues in india
so you have to decide what you wish to
be you want to be a news
outlet or you want to be
an outlet for only the muslims of india
but even if you wish to be an outlet for
only the muslims of india
i would really want you to go and meet
the vast majority of muslims in india
who
who who face
neither deprivation
nor do they nurse any grievances
kanchan gupta said similar things about
the new york times and the washington
post that they also focus too much on
muslim issues but spend any time
watching the channel's feeding news to
indians and you'll realize somebody's
got to do it report on the frightening
trajectory that this story is taking
where it may lead
you may be wondering why aren't we
anchoring this broadcast from new delhi
we tried for months we applied for visas
and were questioned by indian officials
in london and we have yet to hear back
the modi government is clearly sensitive
about foreign news coverage
but if it was just news outlets on the
outside making trouble
why just a few weeks ago would the
editors guild of india heads of
newspapers and magazines condemn
domestic news channels for targeting
vulnerable communities by spewing hatred
and
they compared those news channels to
that rwandan radio station
the one that helped pave the way to
genocide
my central fear really is that we're
dulling down as citizens democracy is
not just about free and fair elections
which we in india we're very good at
that
it's about also making an informed
choice as a citizen
informed by a free and fair media that
holds power to account so when you alter
the very role that the media is supposed
to be playing you subvert democracy
and then it doesn't matter if a muslim
is lynched or if a house is bulldozed
because you've just been numbed to all
of this injustice and you find it quite
normal
their calls for for our boycott
and our extermination
which are getting political currency and
social currency
and which are being justified as as just
some kind of free speech discourse that
we must engage with
[Music]
this kind of
[Music]
hateful debate
day in and day out it's extremely
traumatic
because you're forever trying to engage
or make sense of of this this very
repressive discourse
there's always been violence in india
there's always been violence against
dalits against the tribal people against
muslims against women
but earlier it was seen as an aberration
now this kind of violence has moved
center stage
it's not happening on the margins
it's in fact constituting the new state
