trigger warning india's alarming
escalation in hate speech it's a story
the mainstream media have an aversion to
new year new shutdown beijing's
crackdown on journalism in hong kong
continues
plus informants doing the kremlin's
bidding and putting news organizations
on russia's blacklist
hello i'm richard gisbert and you're at
the listening post where we don't cover
the news we cover the way the news is
covered we begin with india and a social
media space that is teeming with hatred
directed at muslims messages that are
often accompanied with calls for
violence
2022 began with the emergence of a
mobile app conducting a mock auction
online listing the names and the
photographs of dozens of prominent
muslim women put up for sale actresses
activists journalists all of whom have
spoken out on islamophobia and the
notion of hindu supremacy what's known
as hindutva
that auction app appeared online just
after two hindu fundamentalist
conferences were held in northern india
where speakers urged their followers to
attack minorities in speeches that were
tantamount to calls for genocide against
muslims
yet as is the pattern in the world's
second most populous country it took
journalists working outside of
mainstream outlets to expose those
stories forcing establishment news
organizations and the indian authorities
to do what no longer seems to come
naturally their jobs
our starting point this week is new
delhi
in today's india a religious gathering
can turn into a call to arms an
invitation for hindu worshipers to hate
the other there were two such meetings
last month
who runs a far right hindu nationalist
news channel attended the one in new
delhi where he urged his audience to
take an oath
[Music]
[Music]
that same weekend 200 kilometers to the
north in haridwar the message was no
less explicit
[Music]
is an engineer educated in russia and he
is now a hindu priest and a rabble
browser what he says is not as much hate
speech as an outright call for genocide
all his speeches appear to go viral
because he has obviously struck a chord
in hindu society and he does his rabble
browsing with no hindrance from the
government his twitter account has been
suspended and his youtube account uh was
also
blocked because it violated community
guidelines but if you do a quick google
search you'll find his video splashed
across various various channels
news they are blatantly islamophobic
and highly influential especially when
it comes to their short videos which
circulate you know uh widely around
whatsapp
also to add to that
has nearly half a million followers on
twitter it is certainly something we
need to be concerned about but i think
we also need to understand the context
in which they appear a lot of hindu
groups have indeed become radicalized
because of what they see is a one-sided
narrative
both in the secular parties and in the
global media which they are now reacting
to they don't agree with their language
that they use but i certainly believe
understand where they're coming from
there is a very organized
ecosystem of hate they instigate
violence they spread fake news and that
ecosystem is organized by thousands
perhaps millions of people who are
allied with the government they're all
over social media helping to amplify
bigotry of a kind that we have never
seen
before
that bigotry comes in many forms on new
year's eve a new app showed up online
bully by presented itself as a human
auction it was fake but the victims were
real more than 100 muslim women actors
journalists public figures including the
pakistani nobel laureate malala
yousafzai offered up as would-be
servants for their hindu masters
the goal was to shame those women to
silence them
muhammad zubair is a journalist for a
site called alt news
his reporting was crucial in exposing
those hindu gatherings in delhi and
haridwar zubair has also helped police
in their investigations of buliba which
has been taken offline some of those
allegedly involved have been arrested
they call themselves
accounts
triads are something similar to your
nazis or white supremacies these people
uh
they actually even hate bjp because
according to them they are not as
anti-muslim as they think they should be
i'm particularly also in touch with the
mumbai police in helping them
investigate the case and which is still
going on they've uh they've arrested uh
or they've detained three people but i
would say they are not the main culprits
they're all just the pawns they've been
played by the
players
demographically even within the context
of india which is the only country which
has a hindu majority where there are 50
muslim majority countries 100 muslim
christian majority countries so if you
do not protect your culture and heritage
in the one country where you are a
majority
then i think you're going to lose the
battle in terms of protecting what you
have inherited from the past so this is
the broader
context in which all this hate is
happening what stands out most in the
coverage of this story is the lack of it
and it's not for a lack of resources
india has more than 400 24-hour
television news channels more than 100
000 newspapers and countless news sites
most of them have fallen in line with
the ruling bjp party and prime minister
narendra modi
too many news outlets are dependent on
the money modi's government spends on
advertising
in such a competitive market they are as
reliant on the majority hindu population
for clicks and ratings as the bjpr on
hindus for votes
so they gave the stories of those
religious gatherings and the tsunami of
anti-muslim messaging online short
shrift
national newspapers burying reports of
hate speech on the inside pages while
surrendering part of the front page to
the bjp's nationalistic messaging bought
and paid for by the indian taxpayer
the indian express is a best-selling
daily in india now
the advertisements that came on the
front page for shocking
a man
who had a kefir around his neck and
looking very evidently muslim hold like
a petrol bomb in his hand
that's the image they showed of what it
was like before the bjp came in power in
2017. now the next image showed the same
man after 2017 with his hands folded
begging for mercy
this is extremely divisive propaganda
and it also reflects on the state of the
mainstream media in india because the
mainstream media have either been
browbeaten into silence or they have
allied themselves with the government
and they have almost entirely become
cheerleaders of the government and the
ruling party the main television
channels the ones that support the
government have almost completely
ignored the meetings and it's not just
me saying that the party runs fake news
factories a few years ago home minister
amit a most powerful man in this country
addressed party workers and what he
called social media warriors
this is what he said
we are capable of delivering any message
we want to the public
whether sweetos are true or fake because
we have 3.2 million people in our
whatsapp groups
the other institution whose failure to
condemn amounts to a form of complicity
is the indian government
the evidence of incitement is there
online for all to see rhetoric that
verges on the genocidal yet those
responsible almost never get arrested
having pandered to hindu supremacists
when campaigning for votes the modi
government has enabled extremists
normalized their views
and some bjp figures like this member of
parliament can sound just like them
demanding the conversion of non-hindus
those who have gone out of the hindu
folk must be brought back in whole
brought back into the hindu faith
brought back to the mother faith the mp
later withdrew that statement but the
video remains on his youtube channel
it's still making the rounds on social
media
it's not just the media that's supposed
to be the watchdog it's also the
executive
it's also the judiciary
it's also in the parliament in the
legislature there are other authorities
there are other institutions that are
also supposed to act our job now is to
continue to do what we do ask the right
questions
seek accountability because this will
serve as an archive of what's happening
in india the only people who can stop uh
this worrying transformation that's
going on in india are indians themselves
but it is not easy to convert the
converted
[Music]
we've seen that in america
we have seen it in in so many other
countries
the media have a very important role to
play but the mainstream media as we know
are substantially sold out or have been
co-opted by the government so if you're
asking me what is the answer for that i
don't really know i just know that
people like us in the independent media
must continue doing what we can but
there is no one answer as to what can be
done
another media story that's on our radar
this week comes out of hong kong where a
couple of prominent news outlets have
been forced to shut down meenakshi ravi
is here with the details
thank you richard
stan news and citizen news were two of
the last pro-democracy media websites
still active in hong kong they're now
gone and some say it's one of the final
nails in the coffin of hong kong's once
active and outspoken media space
late in december stan's newsroom was
raided by 200 police officers
several staffers were arrested on
suspicion of conspiring to publish what
the authorities called seditious
material on december 27th the outlet
closed down
that had a ripple effect a week later
another outlet citizen news shut down
chris young the founder of citizen news
had this to say
the indications are clear that
overall media is facing a
an increasingly tough
environment
and and for those uh who who are being
seen as uh criticals or troublemakers
um
they are more they are more vulnerable
and that's why we
made the decisions it's worth going back
a bit to understand the political
context to this in 1997 britain which
had colonized hong kong handed back
control of the city to china
beijing publicly committed to allow a
certain level of autonomy but bit by bit
has failed to live up to that promise
instead the chinese communist party has
been tightening its grip on hong kong
with serious implications for democracy
and free speech there
since 2020 when china introduced a
controversial national security law at
least four news outlets have been forced
to close more than a dozen journalists
have been arrested while the authorities
have ordered a complete overhaul of the
public broadcaster rthk
but it's not just news outlets the
enforcement of the national security law
has been used in a manner that squeezes
all kinds of dissenting voices and curbs
discussion let alone debate on sensitive
topics
take the pillar of shame an iconic
statue in memory of the victims of
china's 1989 tiananmen square massacre
for the past 24 years it stood on the
grounds of the university of hong kong
last month though the university's
management decided to remove it citing
legal advice and risk assessments
the disappearance of the statue came as
no surprise to hong kongers but it has
been seen as very symbolic a marker of
just how dramatically the space for
expression has narrowed in hong kong
thank you
in may of last year russian authorities
embarked on a campaign that threatened
to snuff out critical news coverage in
the country completely
dozens of journalists and media outlets
were classified as foreign agents or
worse undesirable
these are labels that are reminiscent of
the country's soviet past and
practically speaking they can have a
ruinous effect on reporting making it
dangerous for journalists to work in
russia as well as deterring both their
sources and their advertisers
some news outlets have been forced to
cease their operations completely
fronting this effort to criminalize
critical news outlets is a handful of
so-called patriotic activists working
for kremlin-friendly organizations they
provide a facade of an active civil
society
russia is a country not short of
underreported news stories taboo topics
such as the abuse of power are not hard
to come by
the listening posts taraknapha now on
some of the news outlets targeted that
have revealed graft and wrongdoing on
the part of the russian elite
[Music]
it literally means to be proclaimed as
an enemy you're a public enemy
our media is completely split into two
camps one group carries its work out
honestly and in good faith
the other slanders and tries to tarnish
our country for a client the client is
well known
the u.s state department and the cia
[Music]
the speed with which this unfolded it
was like someone high up simply said
enough
someone who was done with independent
journalists in russia
he just woke up one spring morning in
2021 and decided
let's just put an end to this
since then it's been open season on
journalists dozens of news organizations
and reporters have been blacklisted
classified as foreign agents undesirable
or both
nobody knows for certain what spurred
the authorities to act
it could have been the botched poisoning
of alexei navalny now imprisoned his
opposition movement outlawed for which
the kremlin faced few consequences
perhaps the authorities were triggered
by what they saw in neighboring belarus
where the government was hunting
journalists down
or was it the larger context the series
of investigative bombshells that have
exposed russian officials revealing
rampant corruption in vladimir putin's
inner circle and beyond
we
tried to
touch
the most tabooed the most
underreported topics
we did a series of articles on the
secret families of russian top rank
officials first was mr putin it was a
story on his secret wife and his
previously unknown daughter we
established that
they have
really enormous wealth this story it was
like a big bomb in russia
so we don't know for sure what was the
immediate story which
made them angry but
i guess all of them
in july last year project a non-profit
registered in the u.s was labeled an
undesirable organization
roman bedanian who was also labeled a
foreign agent learned of his new status
on holiday with his family and made a
decision not to return to russia
one of the more curious aspects of the
case brought against project is the role
played by pro-kremlin activists like
vitaly paradine
bharadiyan is a former employee of
russia's interior ministry who once
called vladimir putin his political idol
he's active on instagram where he shares
photos of himself rubbing shoulders with
russia's elite
borodin made the complaint that
kickstarted proceedings against project
in it he cited verbatim an article from
state-owned broadcaster rt
which alleged project had received
foreign funding
we saw the investigation on rt
we saw that roman bedanian does not hide
his links with the us and decided to
consult the prosecutor's office to check
project funding and list these
journalists as foreign agents
these people who are trying to create a
so-called revolution in this country are
completing an order from the american
intelligence services
and they aren't hiding the fact that
this is what they're doing
in 2020 project examined the close
relationship between the director of
russia's foreign intelligence service
sergey nashkin and billionaire property
developer god nissanoff
russia's top spymaster has seen bumping
fists with the businessman after taking
a swim in his personal pool
baradin says that investigation crossed
the line
these people who worked on a story about
the head of foreign intelligence are
almost the same as terrorists
show me one country where people are
deliberately running around filming
heads of state filming the intelligence
chiefs
bedanian is lucky that our authorities
our special services
let him and journalists like him live in
peace
the russian authorities they need to
have a useful idiot who makes a
complaint that we are
breaking the law
this guy was mr baradin in our case
he does something for the russian
authorities
and he received some benefits from that
some money
some
influence
i run an organization which represents
the interests of the community of our
citizens
what does it mean that we're some kind
of snitches for the kremlin
who calls me that opposition media
why doesn't army accord me that it's a
poster
they are just front men put forward to
create the illusion that there is a big
group of activists fighting for freedom
of information and information
sovereignty
i'm not sure this scheme has worked and
if you meet them you realize that these
people want one thing power and they use
these strange methods of complaining
about independent media to get power for
themselves
[Music]
is a moscow-based correspondent for
meduza whose headquarters are in latvia
the consequences of being a foreign
agent seem designed to slowly kill off
the business model that allowed meduza
to become russia's most popular
independent media outlet
meduza sold advertising to fund its
journalism including to state-owned
companies who bolted after it was listed
as a foreign agent
the outlet lost more than 95
of its advertisers in a week
foreign agents are required to post this
warning alongside whatever they publish
this also needs to be included on
personal posts on social media
the label foreign agent not only deters
advertisers but also sources and
contributors
however it doesn't appear to have put
off medusa's audience donations from a
hundred thousand readers have kept the
outlets afloat for now
i'd say our audience even got slightly
bigger
because everyone was suddenly interested
in who this russian foreign agent was
this repression made people have
compassion for us and we had a
successful crowdfunding campaign
if this whole story of enemies of the
people foreign agents and undesirable
organizations had been put in motion
five years ago when people still trusted
the government it would have had an
effect but now i think it's very limited
i thought
[Music]
that leaves russian news consumers with
a choice journalism produced by what the
kremlin sees as loyal patriots or that
produced by traitors
the foreign agent law first adopted in
2012 and expanded several times since is
being used against almost anyone who
receives money from abroad and voices a
political opinion
but many of the critically minded news
outlets targeted now emerged after
previous government efforts to control
tv and the press they know how to adapt
to survive
based on my experience based on soviet
experience
i believe that
russian
journalism
can survive the future
and survival of russian independent
investigative journalism is in potential
collaborations
we all under attack and the only way
to survive this attack
is to be all together
there are a lot of media outlets who are
surviving on the subscription model and
as far as i can tell medusa isn't about
to close
despite the repression we found enough
subscribers so i can only conclude that
russians are prepared to pay for the
news to keep informed to get insight
into what the world looks like as long
as they have this wish i think we will
definitely survive
and finally back to hong kong the
assault on freedom of the press there
the problem with news headlines about
things like media closures or the
arrests of journalists is that headlines
disappear just as quickly as they appear
and the bigger picture can get lost but
add them all together on a timeline for
instance and the story becomes far more
clear
for more than a decade now china has
been chipping away and more recently
hacking away at free speech in hong kong
we'll leave you now with a timeline that
we've put together on this story and
we'll see you next time here at the
listening post
[Applause]
[Music]
